(group_generator_definition)=
**Group Generator:** the generator of a group is the minimum set of elements of the group that are independent, meaning they cannot be written as a product of any other group elements, but all other group elements can be written as a product of them i.e., all group elements in the generator can be used to create all other group elements.
